# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview:
Build out databases using PostgresSQL and query pertinant employee information to assist the manager in preparing for a large number of retiring employees and to identify a cohort of employees for a mentorship program.

Results:
* Number of managers are eligible for retirement is <1% and none were identified as candidates for the mentorship program. This is expected because the data shows that only 2 managers are still showing as current employees
* There are 33,118 current employees eligible to retire in the near future. The majority of those eligible for retirment have senior status. 50% are classified as "Engineers",  45 % are "Staff", the last 5 % are Technique Leaders and Managers.

Summary:
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
There is going to be a need to fill Engineers and Staff positions as these labor categories show the highest percentage of retirement-eligible emploees.


* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
As shown in the Retiring Titles pie chart above, there is sufficient members nearing retirement to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees
